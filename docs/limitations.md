# Limitations

This page documents limitations that I've read or discovered.

### Using "Blocks"
You cannot have more than 50 blocks in a single message.

### Using Dialogs
You cannot "chain" dialogs together.  This means that you cannot create a workflow
that has one dialog ask for some information, and then open a second
dialog asking for more information that is based on the first.
